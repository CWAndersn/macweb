                  <h4>Bio:</h4>
                  <p>
                    Hey y'all! I'm Alison and like many other Ohioans, I'm super
                    excited about space and flight. Most of my life is currently
                    consumed by psets and Navy ROTC, but in what little spare
                    time I have I like to run, bake, make origami, read, listen
                    to podcasts, and take/send out BuzzFeed quizzes (after all,
                    it is incredibly important to know which potato side dish
                    you are). If I'm not doing any of these things I am probably
                    hanging out in the J1 lounge or trying to maintain a
                    somewhat normal sleep schedule (a rarity around here).
                  </p>
                  <h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
                  <p>
                    It sounds super cheesy and everybody says it, but J entry
                    really is a family. When I make it back at the end of a long
                    day, it feels like I'm going home. I like leaving my door
                    open because I know that there's always something
                    interesting happening, whether it's singing songs from
                    children's TV shows, discussing the current political
                    climate, or calculating exactly how many tortillas we need
                    to make in order to feed 14 people. What's not to love about
                    living with some of your best friends?

                  <p>
                    Ahoy! I'm Ben, a friendly class of 2020 course 6-3! I love
                    to play the saxophone, enjoy a video game or two, and bring
                    the glorious gift of memes to the masses. I'm from Kentucky,
                    though I'm not too much of a southerner (except that I
                    worship sweet tea, for it is the true nectar of the gods).
                    As far as my interests go, I'm a fan of Marvel movies, Harry
                    Potter, Game of Thrones, Stranger Things, and World of
                    Warcraft. While I may be a 6-3, I'm also a huge fan of
                    creative writing! I love to write short stories and
                    hopefully one day will have a good enough idea to write a
                    novel or something.

                  <h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
                  <p>
                    We are one big happy Jamily! We're all so different but we
                    still manage to get along and enjoy each other's different
                    interests. I love that we have study breaks quite often so
                    that I have motivation to leave my room, and I love that
                    with our combined sleep schedules there is almost always
                    someone awake in J entry.

                    Hi! I'm a sophomore and Massachusetts native who has managed
                    to only set off the fire alarm a few times on my home
                    floor-with-the-entry-oven of J3. On campus, I'm on exec for
                    Queer West and MakerLodge, I'm one of the founders of a new
                    student group rising out of the MIT Prison Initiative, and I
                    occasionally predict weather for The Tech. I can be easily
                    bribed with pho and podcast recommendations, so use your
                    power wisely.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
                  <p>
                    In J Entry, I truly feel that I have a family. We are a
                    diverse group of people with different interests,
                    backgrounds, perspectives, and personalities, and we value
                    each other for who we are and what we can learn from each
                    other. You don't need to be one type of person to fit in in
                    J. Many residents go to dinner every day together, play
                    games and watch movies, go on spontaneous 1 AM trips to
                    iHop, or simply stay in the J1 lounge after a typical
                    Saturday night study break having discussions until we
                    realize it's Sunday morning and the sun has come up. There
                    are always people willing to come on adventures, try new
                    things, or just hang out with you, but it's also easy to
                    find time and quiet to yourself when you need it and we
                    support each other through those academic hell weeks that
                    come up during the semester.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    J Entry also sports a rich culture that includes lots of
                    memes, traditions and symbols, (always optional) pranks, and
                    more. Although this may sound cheesy, whenever I come back
                    from a long day and see lights on in the lounges, I know I'm
                    coming home. Whether you've had a great day and want to
                    spread your joy or are having a rough time and need support,
                    people from J are always there for you, and some of my best
                    memories from college so far are from J Entry and the
                    friends I've made here.

                    David is a low-key jenizen who tends to listen to solid jams
                    and read comic books in his free time. He has a strong
                    interest in chemistry and the other natural sciences, and
                    appreciates odd puns, stoic wit, and dark humor. The only
                    thing he likes more than sarcasm is writing about himself in
                    the third person.

                    Civilization, GTA, Skyrim, Mass Effect, Star Trek,
                    Spongebob, and some other stuff. I also enjoy traveling and

                    around here. For a full list of my interests, please contact

                  <p>Because it's the best.</p>
                  <p>
                    When I participated in in-house rush, many entries wowed me
                    with their quirks, food, and conversation. J Entry, however,
                    provided me with a little more. I made real connections, and
                    was able to be completely myself without feeling whatsoever
                    out of place. I could tell from the start that I would make
                    great friends here.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We play video games, watch movies, troll each other (if you
                    need trolling lessons just come over to J2 and ask for
                    Kevin), eat food, walk around Boston, playfully debate, make
                    art, and meme together.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This isn't a complete list. But whether you need a debate
                    about austerity measures in Greece, pop-tarts, movie and
                    music suggestions, someone to go on late night adventures

                  <p>
                    Hello. I currently reside on J3 and am the Packers fan who
                    will occasionally shout at his computer on Sundays. Other
                    than with football, I'm a calm person who enjoys spending my
                    free time running next to the Charles river, listening to
                    podcasts, and/or trying to get another pset done. Around
                    MIT, I'm a member of Cru and a cadet in Air Force ROTC
                    Detachment 365.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
                  <p>
                    Living in J Entry is more than I could have hoped for in a
                    college experience. Not only do I get to live among freshman
                    as we work through GIRs and adapting to college life, but I
                    also get to interact with upperclassmen and hear of their
                    interesting experiences and sage advice. Together, all of
                    these kind, fun, intelligent, and unique people make a
                    community. I think that sense of community is well captured
                    by J Entry dining hall dinners. We try to eat as a group,
                    and I often look forward to hearing about the interesting
                    stories and opinions of everybody. J Entry is home.

                    Hey, its nice to meet youse guys. My name is Jonathan and
                    I'm from the wonderful city of Philadelphia. I'm really
                    fascinated by how materials limit our technological world.
                    Why try to come up with a clever contraption when really
                    what’s standing in your way is the need for nickel based
                    super alloys for turbine or rocket engines, gallium arsenide
                    based semiconductors for high frequency computing, or
                    samarium-cobalt magnets for fusion powered tokamaks. I also
                    have an eye to the sky because this rock that we seem to
                    have started on, I think, is just the beginning. Stick
                    around and I would be delighted to have a chat with you.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
                  <p>
                    J-Entry is easy going, approachable, and fun. We are all
                    pretty low key people that you can see yourself playing your
                    favorite game with, watching a movie, or maybe even knocking
                    out a few problem sets. We're like Jello, but please, only
                    the green kind, not the red, the red is just nasty I
                    honestly cant figure out why people even serve that chaff to
                    people these days. Anyways, like Jello, we bounce around
                    while remaining a relatively comfortable, consistent facet
                    of your residential life.

                    Joyce is your not-self-proclaimed (I swear) guru of indie or
                    roguelike games such as Crypt of the Necrodancer and The
                    Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth. She also does occasionally
                    hype about other worthy video games such as Dark Souls,
                    Bloodborne, and more! Feel free to start a conversation at
                    your own risk. (You'll either be judged or praised for your
                    plebeian tastes.) Other keywords that may be associated with
                    Joyce are: 'art', 'salt', 'puns', and sometimes, 'DIOOO'.

                    Sarcastic, funny, and interesting peeps. I'm terrible at
                    writing these descriptions because there are too many
                    adjectives. Every individual brings a different element of J
                    to the table. Sometimes it results in utter chaos, but in a
                    good way.

                    Hello hello, I love making people laugh and I also love
                    listening to people talk about what they care about. I
                    stress bake and clean and I mostly eat plants unless there’s
                    dessert. (Did someone mention chocolate? Oh wait, that was
                    me). I also enjoy theater, singing terribly, listening to
                    random music, JSWOLE, adventures, traveling, wholesome
                    memes, sarcasm, being awkward, and procrastination. Shoutout
                    to my hometown of Dayton, Ohio, home of the best donuts in
                    the nation, the best museum in the nation, and a bunch of
                    cornfields. At MIT, I’m an Air Force ROTC cadet, a J Entry
                    Co-Social Chair and a MacRAC.

                  <p>
                    I'll set the scene for you: A noob freshman falls in love
                    with an entry the week of IHR while watching memes and
                    murder mysteries. Alas, at this time it was not meant to be;
                    but the entry, in its eternal kindness, welcomed her anyway
                    and now they can’t get rid of her. This is her home now.
                    Inquire for the melodramatic version if you have time to
                    waste.

                    Hi I'm Katie! I love brains (and the minds they create) and
                    exclamation points and I do too many things! I spend a large
                    part of my day on various UROPs (Ask me about my research!
                    Also give me a time limit!), hanging around J entry, and
                    turning psets in at 11:58 PM because that's not technically
                    the last minute. I am best known to the freshmen of
                    MacGregor as "oh yeah, you're that girl from Murder Mystery,
                    you look different when you're not stressed and wearing 6
                    inch stilettos" because I write the script and puzzles for
                    J's bi-annual Murder Mystery dinner. If you want to know
                    more about me and what I do (because, obvi, who wouldn't?)
                    or if you just need a place to chill and complain about The
                    Institvte TM, feel free swing by my room on the fourth
                    floor!
                  </p>
                  <h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
                  <p>
                    You know how in dumb sitcoms everyone somehow all lives in
                    the same apartment or at least spends all their time there
                    and they're just hanging out having fun all the time even
                    though there's definitely not enough space for all of them?
                    That's what it's like living in J entry. I get to come home
                    and see my best friends everyday, then we stay up too late
                    pretending to work on essays while watching memes together,
                    go rock climbing, play board games, get IHOP at 4 AM, prank
                    each other's doors, or do whatever :)

                    Hello. My name is Kip and I am a Course 2 from Southeast
                    Idaho. Between classes, I perform with Roadkill Buffett,
                    MIT's premier improv comedy troupe, and play way more IM
                    hockey than is academically advisable. I love robots,
                    especially the FIRST Robotics Competition (which I competed
                    in all four years of high school), and still continue to
                    mentor FRC Teams. I also enjoy NASCAR and driving to
                    racetracks to watch other live motorsports events with my
                    brother, as well as playing video games with my fellow J
                    residents.

                  <p>
                    J is a fun and inviting place filled with a delightfully
                    strange assortment of interesting people. Although there is
                    not necessarily one central interest that we all share, I
                    have enjoyed learning about other people’s interests, as
                    well as contributing my own to the overarching culture of J.

                  <p>
                    Hi! I am an avid runner, reader, and hiker who lives on J3.
                    Most of my time is spent on psets and MIT track and cross
                    country. After trying to decide whether to major in course 2
                    or 22, I got a UROP in course 22 working on nuclear reactor
                    safety and am majoring in course 2. I'm also one of the rare
                    Californians who prefers Boston weather (having seasons is
                    nice).
                  </p>
                  <h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
                  <p>
                    I love J entry because of people always hanging out in
                    lounges, random discussions (well, maybe arguments) about
                    the most random, unfeasable ideas, friendly people, high
                    quality (and quite a bit of low quality) memes. Also, the
                    study breaks every week are super nice and our annual
                    Thanksgiving dinner is fantastic.

                    Hi, I'm Philip. I'm from the area—about half an hour's drive
                    from MIT when traffic is good. I'm really not sure what else
                    to write about here, so I guess I'll mess with you. Eu falo
                    quatro linguas: inglês, português, sueco, e francês. Det är
                    för att en av mina föräldrar är svensk och en är
                    brasiliansk. Och sen så lärde jag mig franska i skolan. Je
                    ne parle pas français si bien que mes autres langues, mais
                    j'ai reçu des bonnes notes sur les examens stardardisés,
                    alors je dis que je parle français aussi.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you speak any of these languages (including English), I
                    would be happy to converse with you in them. J'ai
                    particulièrement besoin de practiquer mon français. Och om
                    jag har gjort några gramatiska fel eller stavfel i det här
                    meddelandet, låt mig veta.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
                  <p>
                    I like the people here, and for me J-Entry has the right mix
                    of quiet and fun.

                    I am J's resident Brit, sharing the delights of the Isles
                    with the other members of the Entry and the people of
                    America: devotion to Queen and country; appreciation for
                    British wit and charm; a taste for tea and the other finer
                    things in life; education in the correct spelling of things.
                    I am course 2 with a passion for course 22 and will probably
                    end up double majoring. I enjoy running (especially
                    spontaneous sprint races), play the guitar from time to
                    time, and juggle when the feeling takes me.

                    Though it has become something of a cliché, I think it is
                    right to state that the people in J enjoy working hard and
                    playing hard. There are always people in the lounge to have
                    a chat and banter with; when you need some quiet, you will
                    be able to find a place to work in peace. We have a large
                    range of complementary personalities and lots of different
                    interests, and I found it very easy to fit in.

                    Hey all! I'm a junior from a suburb of Chicago, Illinois and
                    now live on J2. I do lots of things with music: I sing in
                    the chamber choir and play piano in the Emerson program.
                    I've also played jazz, marching, and percussion music
                    before. Ask me about anything music! I'm also a fan of
                    baseball and can be found on J2 watching the Cubs game or
                    going to Fenway to watch the Red Sox.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You can find me procrastinating by watching sitcoms like
                    Friends, The Office, Big Bang Theory, etc., cooking on J2,
                    or occasionally going sailing on the Charles.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
                  <p>
                    J Entry is like a college family. Everyone here brings
                    something completely different to the entry, which is
                    exactly what makes it such a great community. People take
                    the time to get to know you, and sometimes procrastinating
                    with others is more important/fun than psets!

                    MIT is nice, not only can I choose less courses for optimal
                    workload, but I can also develop my speaking and physical
                    skills through the compulsory communication requirement and
                    PE requirement. Anyways, I am mainly interested in studying.
                    I also like reading books, solving puzzles and listening to
                    devotional music. I also like to talk about the meaning of
                    life and the state of the world. Please feel free to discuss
                    these topics with me.

                  <h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
                  <p>
                    I wanted to come here so that I may have both privacy and
                    social relations. I have got that here because I have a
                    single room and I meet the residents often in the jamily
                    lunch/dinner, while roaming around the entry, and many other
                    occasions. In particular, I like how the residents are very
                    friendly and welcoming, and how they express their ideas on
                    the door of their room. They also let me play lecture/music
                    at about 6 am in the bathroom.

                    Hello! I'm a triplet from Columbus, Ohio now in J4. I run
                    track, play jazz piano, and looooove indie-rock and
                    psychedelic music, as well as many other things. If you ever
                    want to learn how to unicycle, make a truly amazing
                    sandwich, jam with me on any instrument in any style, go
                    thrifting, check out a concert, or play Scrabble, hit me up.

                      Yes, the bricks look nice, having a single is awesome, and
                      the shower on J4 shoots water like a firehose, but two
                      days into the J entry life, what I've found myself loving
                      most are the friendly people that seem to hide around
                      every corner, making you feel at home with their bright
                      hellos and sincere happiness to see you.

                    Hi, I'm Tyler! I love programming, technology, video games
                    (and designing them), as well as so many other things that I
                    wish I had time to explore. I enjoy thoughtful conversations
                    about anything from multiple universes to the inner workings
                    of society. In general, I just enjoy learning about
                    anything.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I am an absolute fanatic about The Walking Dead (TWD) and
                    all things zombies. You can typically find me wearing TWD
                    shirts or playing zombie games. I also enjoy making puns, no
                    matter how bad they are.

                    immediately stood out as the people I would want to live
                    with. There is such a diverse group of people and I feel

                      "bad" and "water" in a funny way. I am also a fan of water
                      ice and hoagies aka Italian ice and subs for all of you

                      tend to spend a lot of time PSetting with each other in
                      the lounge. J is a collection of fun, interesting, unique,
                      and inspiring individuals. I love every minute I spend
                      with the people in J, and I'm so happy that I was
                      fortunate enough to be in this entry. After walking back
                      from campus at the end of a long day, my favorite thing to
                      do is to look into the J main lounge and see everyone
                      hanging out and cracking up. It truly is the highlight of
                      every day.

                    <p>
                      Freshly returned from my journey abroad to the unknown
                      land that was Cambridge, I am a rising senior in Course
                      6-2 with interests in Big Data and AI. I more than pumped
                      to bring back my appetite and trolling that roamed the J2
                      hallways two years ago.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Despite my absence, some things have not changed to the
                      best of my knowledge. How many more people have rid the
                      entire T?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Outside of collective suffering on problem sets, I like to
                      spend my time watching TV (TBBT FTW), eating, trolling,
                      singing, procrastinating, programming, blowing things up
                      (safely). I would have added sleeping, but my brain and
                      body still seem to have a disagreement about whether it's
                      overrated.

                      I am originally from Peru but I have been living in Miami,
                      Florida for way too long now and the winters here have
                      been quite a great change of pace from the constant
                      asphyxiation that comes with breathing in water as you
                      walk in Miami's humid climate. Things that I like:
                      <ol>
                        <p>1. FC Barcelona</p>
                        <p>
                          2. Music (typically rap: Mac Miller, Chance the
                          Rapper, Lil Dicky, Childish Gambino)
                        </p>
                        <p>3. Making fun of Madelyn</p>
                        <p>4. TV shows (The Simpsons, Rick and Morty, etc.)</p>
                      </ol>

                      The people here are pretty great, I constantly make fun of
                      them and they still tolerate me, it's quite impressive. I
                      also really appreciate the fact that I can always find
                      someone that is willing to help me when I need it, be it
                      with PSETs or baking cookies at 3am. J Entry is pretty
                      cool I guess.

                      Hello! My name is Kevin and I live on J2. I am one of J
                      Entry's social chairs, so it's my job to make sure that
                      you have ample opportunity to meet people and get exposed
                      to all the shenanigans of the entry. I hail from New
                      Jersey and love things that go fast. I work on the Formula
                      SAE team at MIT and take cars very seriously. I'm one of
                      J2's insomniacs and you can always find me in my room at
                      3AM (sometimes working, sometimes just watching racecar
                      videos (because racecar)). I also really enjoy riding my
                      road bike with others when there isn't 3 feet of snow on
                      the ground.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
                    <p>
                      J entry is all about people. I think that the combination
                      of characters that we have in the entry is truly unique
                      and is endlessly entertaining. The sense of camaraderie in
                      the entry is really the distinguishing factor of J entry
                      and not every living group on campus has the same dynamic.

                    <p>
                      Hi. I'm very indecisive about my major, but I like
                      Chemistry and batteries, although I don't know enough
                      about either to really say I like them. I think I want to
                      be an engineer, but I haven't built anything ever, so
                      yeah...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      So that I don't have to think about my lack of concrete
                      goals and aspirations, I keep myself very busy. Besides
                      going to school, I also dive on the Varsity Diving Team,
                      volunteer as a tutor for local school kids, and work as an
                      alumni caller (Tech Caller) to fundraise for MIT. Even
                      though I'm not around the entry that much, I think I
                      contribute to its welcoming environment through the signs
                      on my door that greet anyone entering J3. Some features
                      are Black Science Man, portal unicorn, and Meet the
                      Robinsons.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
                    <p>
                      J is my home away from home. We really are a family here.
                      If you have a bad day, someone is always willing to talk
                      with you or brood with you, whichever fits your mood. If
                      you have a good day, you bet someone will dance around in
                      glee with you. Staying up past three doing psets is not
                      advised, but when you have your fellow jenizens to keep
                      you company, it's not that bad.

                      Hi! I am Maria and even if I may seem grumpy sometimes I
                      am a nice person to talk to. Usually people enjoy making
                      fun of me because well, they have lots of reasons do do
                      that (you'll see), but mainly because I join them and mock
                      myself too. Anyways, as I am a mathmo, I have an equation
                      that describes me perfectly: MATHS+SALSA+FRUITS=LOVE!

                      So this might sound cheesy and/or it might be said a lot,
                      but J-entry is really my home away from home. The
                      residents really are my surrogate family, and in many
                      cases, even more awesome than my ""actual"" family, but
                      shhh don't tell them I said that ;p
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I love that J is such a community and on any given
                      afternoon/evening there are usually at least a couple
                      people hanging out in the entry lounge, whether they're
                      psetting, watching a tv show, playing a video game, having
                      a lively debate, sharing a meal, or just chilling.

                    <p>
                      I'm so happy I found J and that I have the privilege of
                      living with such awesome people!

                      tight knit and truly care about each other. You can always
                      find someone in a lounge or with their door open. Whether
                      you need help on a pset (or procrastinating), a Jenizen
                      will be there. It's common to see us studying, eating
                      dinner, or out in Boston together.

                      I'm pretty regular. I did a lot of stuff at MIT - I was in
                      a sorority, and part of Gospel Choir, E33, DanceTroupe,
                      and MacG exec, so I was never bored. I'm a decent cook,
                      and always down for sharing. I got introduced to Doctor
                      Who my sophomore year and fell in love - and possibly
                      binge watched it for the next two years. I love chocolate
                      and our dessert study breaks. I think watching scary
                      movies on Halloween is a must, even though I can't handle
                      them. Apparently I make entertaining faces also. I
                      graduated this past year and am working for Accenture as a
                      technology consultant in the D.C. area.

                      considering leaving MIT after a difficult year. The J
                      entry GRT took me in and invited me to the annual senior
                      dinner. The other residents immediately started making fun
                      of me, so I knew I would fit in. I moved in after that and
                      found what I was looking for in a dorm - people to be
                      there when I was stressed or sad, to have intelligent (or
                      non-intelligent) conversations with, to say goodnight to,
                      to watch scary movies with, to go out to impromptu dinners
                      with, to watch Doctor Who with, and a million other
                      things. J entry is one of the main reasons I stayed at
                      MIT, and I can honestly say I don't have a single bad
                      memory of living there.

                    <h4>Bio:</h4>
                    <p>
                      Greetings! I am Tricia, former Social Chair, Entry Chair,
                      Supreme Overlord of Reimbursements, Keeper of the Google
                      Docs, Crafter of Titles, and so on. My proudest
                      achievement is the formation of J2 as my legion of
                      underclassman trolls. I was a leader of the campaign to
                      educate all Jenizens in the things that are important in
                      life - namely great movies they should have seen, such as
                      Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, and Back to the Future.
                      I enjoy video games, hiking, terrible puns, Star Wars and
                      Spongebob references, trolling Kevin, going on adventures
                      around Boston, and probably some other things.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
                    <p>
                      It has been said before and it will be said again - the
                      best thing about J Entry is the people. I came to MIT
                      worried about making friends, so during REX I focused on
                      trying to find a place where I could make friends and be
                      happy. One night, as I was wandering through MacGregor, a
                      Jenizen found me and brought me to J. I had fun hanging
                      out in the lounge for a while that night with several
                      residents, but more importantly, I found myself coming
                      back again the next few nights. Hanging out in J was fun,
                      and felt naturally fun, not forced like a lot of REX
                      events, where it obviously isn't like that during the
                      school year (AKA most of the time). I genuinely love the
                      people in J, and I am so glad that it's where I wound up.
                      I even became Social Chair and later Entry Chair -
                      something I never would have seen myself getting involved
                      in before - because of how much I liked J and wanted to
                      make it even more awesome.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      J Entry is a tight-knit place full of friendly, caring,
                      fun individuals, and above all else, feels like a home. J
                      was also just the right kind of fun for me - in a given
                      week, you might experience an all-night p-set party in the
                      main lounge (punctuated by our favorite YouTube videos),
                      covering the whole end of the hallway in a web of yarn
                      with your neighbors, a movie marathon, a spontaneous
                      outing into Boston, or a long chain of terrible, terrible
                      puns. The friends I have made in J are the closest I have.
                      Alas, four years is far too short a time to live among
                      such excellent and admirable Hobbits.

                      Hi! I graduated from MIT in 2009 but loved it so much I
                      stayed for grad school (x2, MD and PhD!). I like to run,
                      play board games, do research, and live in J-Entry as one
                      of your GRTs!

                      Hey! I'm a GRT along with Veena. You will probably see me

                      Hello! I'm a senior in J entry. It's a fabulous place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I'm a lounge dweller - you'll find me hanging out in the
                      main lounge procrastinating or studying (50-50). You may
                      also find me tinkering in my room with my 3D printer. If
                      you need anything fixed, I have tools! :) I also go to
                      class haha.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I'm always happy to talk and down for a board game or a
                      game of pool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Other cool thing - I've sailed across the Atlantic Ocean
                    </p>
                    <h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
                    <p>
                      J entry is a place to relax and unwind after a long drink
                      from the firehose, a good place to get work done while
                      around friends, a place where spontaneous music parties
                      (think the trollolol song) and a place where you'll find
                      people who will take care of you and look out for you.
                      Everyone is friendly and social - social meaning we like
                      talking to friends and leaving our doors open and going to
                      study breaks -- we don't throw parties involving
                      substances or loud music, though we do have spontaneous
                      reenactments of Star Wars lightsaber fights
                    </p>

                      raised in Texas to a family of Colombians (so I'm
                      automatically pretty awesome). Huge fan of Star Wars and
                      bad puns. Currently one of J's co-entry chairs so I help
                      things get done :D

                    <h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
                    <p>
                      I can be myself in J. I can hang out with and talk about
                      the most random crap with people at almost anytime. People
                      even appreciate bad jokes and puns! :D It's a very relaxed
                      place filled with great people :)

                      Hi! I'm David AKA "Brit number two". I am J's resident
                      exchange student from the other Cambridge. I am the host
                      of the J1 cooking show "Cooking with David" and I enjoy
                      Doctor Who, fun times, and sleeping. I'm enjoying
                      exploring the New England area before returning to the
                      original England. You can find in the main lounge at all
                      times, usually psetting, or avoiding psetting.

                      Yo, I'm Jasmin on J-1. I am on the MIT cheer team, and
                      when I don't have practice, I enjoy going out with friends
                      or playing on Xbox. I love Disney, Spiderman, so many TV
                      shows (more than I should watch), SNAPCHAT, and naps.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
                    <p>
                      I love the family-feeling in J entry and the fact that the
                      main lounge practically always has someone there to talk
                      to. The people are so approachable and nice!

                      A course 14 pretentious tryhard from northern Michigan. I
                      spend most of my free time chilling around J Entry, at
                      Hayden Library or listening to hipster trash (e.g. indie
                      rock, experimental electronic, and hip hop). Sometimes I
                      play Civilization and then remember how bad I am at it and
                      stop.

                      4AM while eating pizza rolls

                    <p>
                      J Entry is a cool, caring community (but not in a cheesy
                      70's sitcom kind of way); your friends here will always
                      look out for you. It's a great group of people from
                      diverse interests and backgrounds, and we've also got a
                      (relatively) laid-back culture. Also sometimes we go to
                      IHOP at 2AM which is excellent.

                      Android developer, 6.01 TA, connoisseur of memes and the
                      Internet at large. Nintendo fangirl and sick Skyrim

                    <h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
                    <p>
                      I was basically adopted by J entry my junior year, after
                      forming a p-set group with a couple residents. I was
                      amazed at how welcoming and friendly the entry is and how
                      quickly I became friends with anybody new I met while
                      working in the lounge. Soon enough it was obvious that I
                      should move in with all of my favorite people, so I could
                      stop walking over freezing in my pajamas to play Pokemon
                      at 2am instead. J entry is the most caring and supportive
                      community I've encountered at MIT, and if you're facing a
                      tough week you can be certain there are friends here who
                      will cheer you up, help you out, and maybe even surprise
                      you with late-night chocolate cake. And that's not to
                      mention all the shenanigans we get up to involving bad
                      puns, worse trolls, and spontaneous adventures. It's home!
