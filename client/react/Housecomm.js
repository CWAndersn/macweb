                      Ask the entry chairs for your new room assignment. If they

                      Inform your current entry chairs that you will be leaving
                      the entry so they can assign your current room to someone
                      else.

                    <li>
                      Wait for an email from Bob Ramsay or the RAC saying that
                      your new room is ready for you to move in.

                  This process applies year-round, although mid-semester
                  requests are likely to be deferred to the end of the semester.

                  All incoming freshmen tempted in MacGregor will be assigned a temporary room  for the week of orientation/REX. At this point, all freshmen tempted in
                  MacGregor will have the option to remain in MacGregor or <a href="https://studentlife.mit.edu/housing/first-year/first-year-residence-exchange-fyre">FYRE</a> out to another dorm.
                  After the dorms have been finalized, MacGregor will hold an event called In-House Rush to sort freshmen into the entry which best suits them. In-House Rush(IHR) is typically
                  held on the last Wednesday of August. Freshman are matched to each entry using a stable-marriage algorithm, which takes into account the preference of the freshman, as well as
                  the preferences of the current residents of the entry, in addition to several other variables. On the night of IHR, freshmen will be split into 10 groups, which will then spend 15
                  minutes in each entry(plus one break period) getting to know the residents and the culture of the entry. After each group has been to each entry, there will be a 30 minute free roam
                  period during which the freshmen can visit any entry they liked/wanted to know more about to help their decision. After that, each freshman will submit a ranking to the Rooming Assignment Chairs,
                  and each entry will also submit a ranking of the freshmen. These rankings are entirely confidential and will not be revealed at any point. The freshmen will then be assigned
                  an entry, and the entry will be responsible for assigning them a room within the entry that best suits their preferences. The following morning, freshmen will be required to move their belongings
                  to the dining hall so that all rooms can be cleaned(belongings will be watched at all points in time to ensure their safety). While this may seem like a great ordeal for many people,
                  MacGregor residents are willing to help move heavy belongings.
