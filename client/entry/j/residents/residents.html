						<p>
							Hi! I'm a lightweight rower and wannabe Canadian who enjoys spending my free time terrorizing J-1 in a pikachu onesie. I enjoy music, art, running, and making it my mission to kick ass, go to space, and represent the human race.
						</p>
						<h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
						<p>
							I love the quirkiness and the genuine support and care that everyone shows for each other here. Whenever I'm having a bad day or need help with something, my entry is always there to make it better.

						<h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>

							David is a low-key jenizen who tends to listen to solid jams and read comic books in his free time. He has a strong interest in chemistry and the other natural sciences, and appreciates odd puns, stoic wit, and dark humor. The only thing he likes more than sarcasm is writing about himself in the third person.

						<h4>Bio:</h4>
						<p>
							Hi
						</p>
						<p>
							I am a sophomore.
						</p>
						<p>
							I like pop-tarts, memes, and Arizona Black and White Tea.
						</p>
						<p>
							Outside of these, I enjoy things such as Star Wars, Back to the Future, Pixar stuff, Civilization, GTA, Skyrim, Mass Effect, KotOR, Apocalypse Rising, Star Trek, Spongebob, and a lot of other stuff. For a full list of my interests, please contact me at epw@mit.edu.
						</p>
						<p>
							In my free time (procrastination time), I'll watch TeenNick while laying on my futon, bum around Boston, take a walk to McDonald's, or do some indie game development.
						</p>
						<p>
							It is possible (however unlikely) that I will occasionally go overboard on my love for Tesla Motors and SpaceX. Don't worry, though; this is primarily a ploy to get on Jonathan's nerves (check him out if you haven't, already. 10/10 would recommend).
						</p>
						<h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
						<p>
							J is the best. It's obviously difficult to summarize why, but I'll attempt to.
						</p>
						<p>
							When I participated in in-house rush, many entries wowed me with their quirks, food, and conversation. J Entry, however, provided me with a little more. I made real connections, and was able to be completely myself without feeling whatsoever out of place. I could tell from the start that I would make great friends here.
						</p>
						<p>
							We play video games, watch movies, troll each other (if you need trolling lessons just come over to J2 and ask for Kevin), eat food, walk around Boston, playfully debate, make art, and meme together.
						</p>
						<p>
							This obviously isn't a complete list. But whether you need an exercise partner, a debate about austerity measures in Greece, pop-tarts, movie and music suggestions, someone to go on late night adventures with you, or some spare paperclips to bind a pset together, you can find it in J.
						</p>
						<p>
							And that's a beautiful thing.
						</p>

						<h4>Bio:</h4>
						<p>
							A course 14 pretentious tryhard from northern Michigan. I spend most of my free time chilling around J Entry, at Hayden Library or listening to hipster trash (e.g. indie rock, experimental electronic, and hip hop). Sometimes I play Civilization and then remember how bad I am at it and stop.
						</p>
						<p>
							Interests include: Whining about the system, procrastinating, apple juice, listening to vaporwave at 4AM while eating pizza rolls
						</p>
						<h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
						<p>
							J Entry is a cool, caring community (but not in a cheesy 70's sitcom kind of way); your friends here will always look out for you. It's a great group of people from diverse interests and backgrounds, and we've also got a (relatively) laid-back culture. Also sometimes we go to IHOP at 2AM which is excellent.

							Hey, its nice to meet youse guys. My name is Jonathan and I'm from the wonderful city of Philadelphia.  I'm really fascinated by materials how they limit our technological world. I hope to one day work on new super alloys that can other, much more clever individuals, can mold into the most amazing machines. I like to bring my Philly attitude and a slice of the Mediterranean to my less gastronomically educated friends. Good life, good tech, good eats.
						</p>
						<h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
						<p>
							J-Entry is easy going, approachable, and fun. We are all pretty low key people that you can see yourself playing your favorite game with, watching a movie, or maybe even knocking out a few problem sets. We're like Jello, but please, only the green kind, not the red, the red is just nasty I honestly cant figure out why people even serve that chaff to people these days. Anyways, like Jello, we bounce around while remaining a relatively comfortable, consistent facet of your residential life.

							Joyce is your not-self-proclaimed (I swear) guru of indie or roguelike games such as Crypt of the Necrodancer and The Binding of Isaac. She also does occationally hype about other worthy video games. If you happen to find her ""arting,"" do not worry, this mitigates side effects of MIT. El Psy Congroo.
						</p>
						<h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
						<p>
							Sarcastic, funny, and interesting peeps. I'm terrible at writing these descriptions because there are too many adjectives. Every individual brings a different element of J to the table. Sometimes it results in utter chaos, but in a good way.

							Hello! My name is Kevin and I live on J2. I am one of J Entry's social chairs, so it's my job to make sure that you have ample opportunity to meet people and get exposed to all the shenanigans of the entry. I hail from New Jersey and love things that go fast. I work on the Formula SAE team at MIT and take cars very seriously. I'm one of J2's insomniacs and you can always find me in my room at 3AM (sometimes working, sometimes just watching racecar videos (because racecar)). I also really enjoy riding my road bike with others when there isn't 3 feet of snow on the ground.
						</p>
						<h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
						<p>
							J entry is all about people. I think that the combination of characters that we have in the entry is truly unique and is endlessly entertaining. The sense of camaraderie in the entry is really the distinguishing factor of J entry and not every living group on campus has the same dynamic.

						</p>
						<h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
						<p>
							I was basically adopted by J entry my junior year, after forming a p-set group with a couple residents.  I was amazed at how welcoming and friendly the entry is and how quickly I became friends with anybody new I met while working in the lounge.  Soon enough it was obvious that I should move in with all of my favorite people, so I could stop walking over freezing in my pajamas to play Pokemon at 2am instead.  J entry is the most caring and supportive community I've encountered at MIT, and if you're facing a tough week you can be certain there are friends here who will cheer you up, help you out, and maybe even surprise you with late-night chocolate cake.  And that's not to mention all the shenanigans we get up to involving bad puns, worse trolls, and spontaneous adventures.  It's home!

						<h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>

							So this might sound cheesy and/or it might be said a lot, but J-entry is really my home away from home. The residents really are my surrogate family, and in many cases, even more awesome than my ""actual"" family, but shhh don't tell them I said that ;p
						</p>
						<p>
							I love that J is such a community and on any given afternoon/evening there are usually at least a couple people hanging out in the entry lounge, whether they're psetting, watching a tv show, playing a video game, having a lively debate, sharing a meal, or just chilling.
						</p>
						<p>
							I'm so happy I found J and that I have the privilege of living with such awesome people!

							I am J's resident Brit, sharing the delights of the Isles with the other members of the Entry and the people of America: devotion to Queen and country; appreciation for British wit and charm; a taste for tea and the other finer things in life; education in the correct spelling of things. I am course 2 with a passion for course 22 and will probably end up double majoring. I enjoy running (especially spontaneous sprint races), play the guitar from time to time, and juggle when the feeling takes me.
						</p>
						<h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
						<p>
							Though it has become something of a cliché, I think it is right to state that the people in J enjoy working hard and playing hard. There are always people in the lounge to have a chat and banter with; when you need some quiet, you will be able to find a place to work in peace. We have a large range of complementary personalities and lots of different interests, and I found it very easy to fit in.

						<h4>Bio:</h4>
						<p>
							I'm pretty regular. I did a lot of stuff at MIT - I was in a sorority, and part of Gospel Choir, E33, DanceTroupe, and MacG exec, so I was never bored. I'm a decent cook, and always down for sharing. I got introduced to Doctor Who my sophomore year and fell in love - and possibly binge watched it for the next two years. I love chocolate and our dessert study breaks. I think watching scary movies on Halloween is a must, even though I can't handle them. Apparently I make entertaining faces also. I graduated this past year and am working for Accenture as a technology consultant in the D.C. area.
						</p>
						<h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
						<p>
							I had a bad dorm experience freshman year and was considering leaving MIT after a difficult year. The J entry GRT took me in and invited me to the annual senior dinner. The other residents immediately started making fun of me, so I knew I would fit in. I moved in after that and found what I was looking for in a dorm - people to be there when I was stressed or sad, to have intelligent (or non-intelligent) conversations with, to say goodnight to, to watch scary movies with, to go out to impromptu dinners with, to watch Doctor Who with, and a million other things. J entry is one of the main reasons I stayed at MIT, and I can honestly say I don't have a single bad memory of living there.

						<p>
							Greetings! I am Tricia, former Social Chair, Entry Chair, Supreme Overlord of Reimbursements, Keeper of the Google Docs, Crafter of Titles, and so on. I lived in the same room in J Entry my entire time at MIT. My proudest achievement is the formation of J2 as my legion of underclassman trolls. I was a leader of the campaign to educate all Jenizens in the things that are important in life - namely great movies they should have seen, such as Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, Back to the Future, and Indiana Jones. I was Mama J for a time, and had weekly brownie nights for the entry, then became Grandma J and now Great Grandma J in my old age. I enjoy video games, hiking, terrible puns, Star Wars and Spongebob references, trolling Kevin, going on middle-of-the-night (or daytime) adventures around Boston, and probably some other things.
						</p>
						<h4>Why I Love J Entry:</h4>
						<p>
							It has been said before and it will be said again - the best thing about J Entry is the people. I came to MIT worried about making friends. During REX, I focused very hard on trying to find a place where I could make friends and be happy. One night, as I was wandering through MacGregor, a Jenizen found me and brought me to J Entry. I had fun hanging about in the lounge for a while that night with several residents, but what happened next was more important - I found myself coming back again the next few nights. Hanging out in J was fun, and more importantly, felt naturally fun, not forced like a lot of REX events, where it obviously isn't like that during the school year (AKA most of the time). I genuinely love the people in J, and I am so glad that it's where I wound up. I even became Social Chair and later Entry Chair - something I never would have seen myself getting involved in before - because of how much I liked J and wanted to make it even more awesome.

							J Entry is a tight-knit place full of friendly, caring, fun individuals, and above all else, feels like a home. J is also just the right kind of fun for me - in a given week, you might experience an all-night p-set party in the main lounge (punctuated by our favorite YouTube videos), covering the whole end of the hallway in a web of yarn with your neighbors, a movie marathon, fresh-baked desserts, a spontaneous outing into Boston, or a long chain of terrible, terrible puns. The friends I have made in J are the closest I have. Alas, four years is far too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable Hobbits.
